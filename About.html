					<p>I am an Experience Designer, storyteller, and 3D designer with 7+ years experience working in XR and Immersive media. I love telling stories with art and technology that highlight the messy and beautiful relationships people have in this world.

					<p>
					With my past working as a creative designer and researcher in various research labs, I utilize my expertise in spatial design, interaction design, and real-time pipelines to push the boundaries of Mixed Reality.</p>
