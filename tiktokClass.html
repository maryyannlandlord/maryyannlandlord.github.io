			 To officially introduce Effect House and increase excitement for the upcoming Spring course, I partnered with product to run a workshop that included 2 interactive demos and discussions around AR. After the Spring class roster filled with 16 students, we sent out a pre-class survey to understand students' background.

			 Upon launching the class, students were really excited to use Effect House. To inspire students in their Effect Creation journey, I invited a well-known TikTok Effect Creator Laura Goullion to give a lecture. Each student created a project for their midterm. We noticed <span style = "font-weight: bold;">many students used the same randomizer template and no students had published onto TikTok .</span>
