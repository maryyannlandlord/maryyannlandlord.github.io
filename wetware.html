			I started the project by researching existing games and opinions around AI ethnics. We explored texts by philosophers like <a class = "link" target = "_blank" href = "https://www.amazon.com/Minds-Fantasies-Reflections-Self-Soul/dp/0465030912">Daniel Dennett</a> and his writings on free will. We also interviewed notable scientists like David Hanson at <a href = "https://www.hansonrobotics.com/" target = "_blank" class = "link">Hanson Robotics</a> about his thoughts on AI ethics and general intelligence. This initial research helped us build our game goals.

						<br>
						<p>We were inspired by <a href = "https://papersplea.se/" target = "_blank" class = "link">Papers Please</a>, which emphasizes the simple interaction of stamping "approved" or "denied" to determine if an immagrant is accepted into the country. In Wetware, players repeatedly probe the drone everyday. It combines the weight of moral and civic reponsibility with the emotional numbness from repitition as you directly determine the fate of lives.</p> 
						<br>
						<p>Players speak with items in the lab, rather than inspecting them. In a world filled with "intelligent" agents, it is easier to accept the enemy drone's level of intelligence.</p>
