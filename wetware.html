				Wetware is my MFA thesis. It is a first-person game about the interplay between AI ethics and consciousness. 
				You are a lab scientist tasked with probing information from a captured enemy drone. Your country is at war and you're the only hope. As you work to uncover enemy plans, you learn there's more secrets in the lab than just those from the enemy drone.

			I started the project by researching existing games and opinions around AI ethnics. We explored texts by philosophers like <a class = "link" target = "_blank" href = "https://www.amazon.com/Minds-Fantasies-Reflections-Self-Soul/dp/0465030912">Daniel Dennett</a> and his writings on free will. We also interviewed notable scientists like David Hanson at <a href = "https://www.hansonrobotics.com/" target = "_blank" class = "link">Hanson Robotics</a> about his thoughts on AI ethics and general intelligence. This initial research helped us build our game goals.
